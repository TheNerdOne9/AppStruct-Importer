# AppStruct-Importer
AppStruct Importer is a Burp Suite extension written in python which allows users to load a list of URLs already parsed to your target sitemap or even select the app folder to be parsed and generate a list of URLs based on the files included in it.
Once you have a list, you are able to run a HTTP request to each URL and check every successful connection with your current cookie, which i recommend you to set on your Project Options. Each successful connection will then be added to your target sitemap.
